# Set the release bot credentials

Set these repository values so that GitHub Actions can create a GitHub App
token for the release bot:

- Variable: `RELEASE_BOT_APP_ID`
- Secret: `RELEASE_BOT_PRIVATE_KEY`

## 1. Check the GitHub App

1. Open the [GitHub App installation settings](https://github.com/settings/installations/152797047).
2. Make sure that the app has access to the applicable repository.
3. Open the app from the [GitHub Apps settings](https://github.com/settings/apps).
4. Get the **App ID** from the **General** page.
5. In **Private keys**, select **Generate a private key**.
6. Download the PEM file.

Do not use the client ID, client secret, or installation ID.

You cannot download an existing private key again. If you do not have the
private key, generate a new key.

## 2. Set the repository values

Before you continue, use GitHub CLI to sign in to GitHub. Run these commands
from the root directory of the repository:

```sh
export RELEASE_BOT_APP_ID=4553309
export RELEASE_BOT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=./.kentrino/private-key.pem

gh variable set RELEASE_BOT_APP_ID --body "$RELEASE_BOT_APP_ID"
gh secret set RELEASE_BOT_PRIVATE_KEY < "$RELEASE_BOT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH"
```

Do not put the contents of the PEM file in a command-line argument or a shell
variable.

After you set the repository values, move the PEM file to a secure location.
If you do not need the file, delete it. Then, remove the environment variables:

```sh
unset RELEASE_BOT_APP_ID RELEASE_BOT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH
```

## 3. Make sure that the repository values are set

Run these commands:

```sh
gh variable list
gh secret list
```

Make sure that the output contains `RELEASE_BOT_APP_ID` and
`RELEASE_BOT_PRIVATE_KEY`. GitHub does not show the value of the secret.

The following workflows use these credentials:

- `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- `.github/workflows/pinact.yml`
